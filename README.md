# IntelliForge
IntelliForge is an intellij IDEA plugin for developing minecraft forge mods.

## How to get it?
To get intelliforge, as of _right now_ clone this repo, and it _should_ open as an intellij project. Right click the project and click prepare for deployment, or something like that. It should make a plugin that you can install like any other plugin

## What can it do?
Right now, it can automatically download forge and setupDecompWorkspace for you, as well as some simple tasks such as building the mod and setting up curse intergration.
### What can we expect it to do?
Planned features include
 - Auto generation of complex templates, such as blocks and items with stub functions
 - GUI Editor (maybe)
 - Common error inspector (checking whether ResourceLocations will actually resolve, etc..)
 - ASM Generator

## When will the next push be?
Don't ask us.
